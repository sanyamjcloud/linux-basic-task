#Linux Environment setup & exploration-Summary

In this task, I installed Ubuntu linux on virtualbox and explored the linux file system
using terminal commands. I practiced directory navigation, file creation, permissions management
and system monitoring using tools like top, df and free. This task helped me become
confident in using linux through the command line.
